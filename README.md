This Repo contains both the backend Node.js API and the python script to convert a CSV file to a dict and then to a JSON object, outputting it in a .JS file. 

The backend api allows the admin to submit an API call to a server which saves all the users email's address and then sends an email to all those users and sms.

To run this file, you must run the parser.py using terminal and feed it a test CSV named example4.csv with at least a column called 'Key'

to run the API, you will need to install Node.js, then run npm start from the terminal.
